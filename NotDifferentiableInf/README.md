Example of a function that is continuous everywhere but not differentiable at infinitiley many points (in the interval [-1,1] in fact)
This function's graph is given in the statement of the problem and Spivak challenges the reader to find an expression that explicitly describes it. After working on it with pen and paper, I found the expression and in order to verify it is correct, plotted the function using Matlab.

Additional note: I have never studied fractals formally, but I think the graph is indeed a fractal, since no matter how much you zoom into it, the figure is self similar, that is, when you zoom in, what you see is just a composition of smaller versions of the figure.
