Example of a function that is continuous everywhere but not differentiable at infinitiley many points (in the interval [-1,1] in fact)
This function's graph is given in the statement of the problem and Spivak challenges the reader to find an expression that explicitly describes it. After working on it with pen and paper, I found the expression and in order to verify it is correct, plotted the function using Matlab.
